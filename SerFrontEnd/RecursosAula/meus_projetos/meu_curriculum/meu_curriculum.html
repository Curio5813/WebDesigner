    <p>I worked as a production manager on a family-owned farm managing the entire production cycle in the
        cultivation of agricultural products in a hydroponic environment. The work gave me a strategic view of the
        agricultural market and the opportunity to learn about the nutritional and pest and disease control needs of
        plants. I developed a strategic plan for all production stages, from the purchase of basic inputs to the sale in
        the wholesale and retail market, positioning the company for its qualitative differential.
